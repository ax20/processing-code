# Processing
A compilation of code written in Processing for my Information Technology 10 course

## Description
I learnt this language during class in IT 10, and I created various applications and games using it. I also partially used this language to program Arduino to achieve specific tasks like controlling a display, audio driver, and camera. This repository also contains one of the games I created, "Flappy Ball."

## Getting Started

### Build & Run

* Ensure you have [Processing](https://processing.org/download) downloaded on the local machine
* Drag desired project folder into Processing and execute script
